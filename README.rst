MTObjects

MTObjects is a tool for detecting sources in astronomical images, and creating segmentation maps and parameter tables.

This is a work in progress - use at your own risk. Questions, bug reports, and suggested features are very welcome.

Python implementation by Caroline Haigh (University of Groningen).

Based on the original C implementation by Paul Teeninga et al [1]

--------------------------

Build instructions:

Python dependencies - pip install:

- scikit-image
- astropy
- matplotlib
- Pillow
- SciPy
- numpy
- pandas*
- photutils


For the installation of SkyServer, refer to this link(https://github.com/sciserver/SciScript-Python)

The program is written for python 3.

To recompile the C libraries, run ./recompile.sh

--------------------------

To get help: 

::

	python mto.py -h

To run with default parameters: 

::

	python mto.py [path/to/image.fits]

To include more faint outskirts of objects, a lower move_factor value (0.0 - 0.3) is recommended: 

::

	python mto.py [path/to/image.fits] -move_factor 0.3

--------------------------

Arguments:

  -h, --help            Show the help message and exit
  -out  	        Location to save filtered image. Supports .fits and .png filenames
  -par_out		Location to save calculated parameters. Saves in .csv format
  -soft_bias		Constant bias to subtract from the image
  -gain		        Gain (estimated by default)
  -bg_mean		Mean background (estimated by default)
  -bg_variance		Background variance (estimated by default)
  -alpha	        Significance level - for the original test, this must be 1e-6
  -move_factor          Higher values reduce the spread of large objects.
				Default = 0.5
  -min_distance         Minimum brightness difference between objects.
				Default = 0.0
  -verbosity		Verbosity level (0-2)

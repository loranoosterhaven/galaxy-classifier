As part of the GZ2 data release (Tables 5–9), we provide a
short abbreviation (gz2 class) that indicates the most common consensus classification for the galaxy. We emphasise
that the intent is not to create a new classification system;
rather, this is only a convenient shorthand for interpreting
portions of the GZ2 results.
The gz2 class string is generated for each galaxy by
taking the largest debiased vote fraction (beginning with
Task 01) and selecting the most common response for each
subsequent task in the decision tree.
Galaxies that are smooth (from Task 01) have gz2 class
strings beginning with ‘E’. Their degree of roundness (completely round, in-between, and cigar-shaped) is represented
by ‘r’,‘i’, and ‘c’, respectively.
Galaxies with features/disks have gz2 class strings beginning with ‘S’. Edge-on disks follow this with ‘er’, ‘eb’, or
‘en’ (with the second letter classifying the bulge shape as
round, boxy, or none). For oblique disks, the letter following
‘S’ is an upper-case ‘B’ if the galaxies have a bar. The bulge
prominence (‘d’ = none, ‘c’ = just noticeable, ‘b’ = obvious,
‘a’ = dominant). Both bars and bulges follow the same general trends as the Hubble sequence, although the correspondence is not exact. If spiral structure was identified, then
the string includes two characters indicating the number
(1, 2, 3, 4, +, ?) and relative winding (‘t’=tight, ‘m’=medium,
‘l’=loose) of the spiral arms.
Finally, any feature in the galaxy the users identified
as “odd” appears at the end of the string in parentheses:
‘(r)’=ring, ‘(l)’=lens/arc, ‘(d)’=disturbed, ‘(i)’=irregular,
‘(o)’=other, ‘(m)’=merger, ‘(u)’=dust lane.
Objects that are stars or artifacts have the gz2 class string ‘A’.
For example: • Er = smooth galaxy, completely round • SBc2m = barred disk galaxy with a just noticeable bulge
and two medium-wound spiral arms • Seb = edge-on disk galaxy with a boxy bulge • Sc(I) = disk galaxy with a just noticeable bulge, no
spiral structure, and irregular morphology. • A = star
